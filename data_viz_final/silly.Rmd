## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}

dead_zones_shapefile <- st_read("dead_zones/Maryland_Chesapeake_Bay_Dead_Zones_-_Chesapeake_Bay_Dead_Zones/ENVL_ChesapeakeBayDeadZones_DNR.shp")

counties <- counties() 

md_counties <- counties %>%
  filter(STATEFP == "24")

md_counties %>%
  ggplot() + 
  geom_sf() + 
  theme_minimal()

dead_zones_shapefile %>%
  ggplot() + 
  geom_sf() + 
  theme_minimal()

ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data=md_counties) + 
  geom_sf(data=dead_zones_shapefile) +
  geom_point(size = .000001)
  theme_minimal()

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

county_json <- geojson_json(md_counties)

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
